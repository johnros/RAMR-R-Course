## What is R? {#what-r}

R was not designed to be a bona-fide programming language. 
It is an evolution of the S language, developed at Bell labs (later Lucent) as a wrapper for the endless collection of statistical libraries they wrote in Fortran.

As of 2011, half of R's libraries are [actually written in C](https://wrathematics.github.io/2011/08/27/how-much-of-r-is-written-in-r/). 



## The R Ecosystem {#ecosystem}

A large part of R's success is due to the ease in which a user, or a firm, can augment it. 
This led to a large community of users, developers, and protagonists. 
Some of the most important parts of R's ecosystem include:

- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/): 
a repository for R packages, mirrored worldwide.

- [R-help](https://www.r-project.org/mail.html): 
an immensely active mailing list. 
Noways being replaced by StackExchange meta-site. 
Look for the R tags in the [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [CrossValidated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) sites.

- [Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/): 
part of CRAN that collects packages per topic. 

- [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/): 
A CRAN-like repository dedicated to the life sciences. 

- [Neuroconductor](https://www.neuroconductor.org/):
A CRAN-like repository dedicated to neuroscience, and neuroimaging. 

- [Books](https://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-books.html): 
An insane amount of books written on the language. Some are free, some are not. 

- [The Israeli-R-user-group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/israel-r-user-group): 
just like the name suggests.

- Commercial R: being open source and lacking support may seem like a problem that would prohibit R from being adopted for commercial applications. 
This void is filled by several very successful commercial versions such as [Microsoft R](https://mran.microsoft.com/open/), with its accompanying CRAN equivalent called [MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/),  [Tibco's Spotfire](http://spotfire.tibco.com/discover-spotfire/what-does-spotfire-do/predictive-analytics/tibco-enterprise-runtime-for-r-terr), and [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#Commercial_support_for_R).

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/): since its earliest days R came equipped with a minimal text editor. 
It later received plugins for major integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse, WinEdit and even [VisualStudio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/rtvs/). 
None of these, however, had the impact of the RStudio IDE. 
Written completely in JavaScript, the RStudio IDE allows the seamless integration of cutting edge web-design technologies, remote access, and other killer features, making it today's most popular IDE for R.
